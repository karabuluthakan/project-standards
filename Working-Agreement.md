# Team Working Agreement

We are all one team. We all discuss and make decisions that impact us all as a team.

## Working hours

- Office hours are 9AM-4PM Seattle TimeZone (6PM-1AM CET TimeZone) Monday-Friday
- No meetings scheduled outside of agreed working hours
- No expectations to reply to messages or review PRs outside office hours
- No expectations to work late in the night or over the weekend
- Be respectful of timezones and team members' working schedule

## Sprint Week

- The sprint starts on Thursdays and Ends on Wednesdays with Demos, Retrospective and Sprint Planning

## Meetings

- All meetings should have an agenda and a clearly communicated objective
- All meetings should be planned at least a few days in advance
- Sprint planning, Sprint demo, Retrospectives and Daily Standup should always happen at the same time every week
- All meetings should have a time keeper to ensure the meeting doesn't overrun
- If you cannot attend one of the meetings, try to let the team know at least 15 minutes in advance

## Standups

- Starts on time and it should not take longer than the pre-agreed time
- Format: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Any blockers?
- Any in-depth discussion should be taken offline
- Everyone should try to attend standups daily, but if not possible send an offline message on Teams with your status update

## Retrospectives

- Retrospectives are set to Wednesdays
- Everyone should give 4 votes to the available retro groups before the Retro
- Discussion about each entry is time boxed - 3 to 4 minutes

## Demos

- Demos are done on Wednesdays as part of the end of the sprint
- Demos should be announced to the scrum master the day before the demo
- Demos are strictly time boxed and should focus on informing the team or demoing acceptance criteria for User Stories

## Sprint Planning

- Sprint Planning involves the whole team, with Product Owners as mandatory
- Before Sprint Planning, everyone should add their capacity to the sprint.
- The User Stories that were not finished in the previous sprint are moved to the next sprint or backlog as appropriate. Remaining time for the tasks is estimated and any new tasks needed are added and estimated.
- The top prioritized new User Stories are defined with Acceptance Criteria
- Each of the potential User Stories are split into an initial set of tasks and the tasks are estimated. (some prep may be done before to speed things up)
- User Stories are added to the next sprint until capacity is met.
- Split each dev task in the story into 3 (Research, Implementation, Review). This doesn't apply if you felt the task is too short.
- Main goals: 1. something working and 2. ability of recreating it independently (documentation on this project is highly important).
