## Sprint Week

## Meetings

- All meetings should have an agenda and a clearly communicated objective
- All meetings should be planned at least a few days in advance
- Sprint planning, Sprint demo, Retrospectives and Daily Standup should always happen at the same time every week
- All meetings should have a time keeper to ensure the meeting doesn't overrun
- If you cannot attend one of the meetings, try to let the team know at least 15 minutes in advance

## Standups

- Starts on time and it should not take longer than the pre-agreed time
- Format: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Any blockers?
